    a. linear : items are arranged in memory in linear seq manner 
                i. Static : sizes are fixed -array
                ii. Dynamic : changes -linked list, stack,queue
    b. non linear : data not org. seq. - tree,graph
 Each data structure is unique and have different features.

 2. Divide and conquer Algo
 3. Dynamic prog Algo
 4. Greedy algo
 5. Brute force Algo
